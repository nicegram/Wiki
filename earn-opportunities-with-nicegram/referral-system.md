# Referral System

The Referral System in Nicegram is a strategic feature designed to reward users for expanding the Nicegram community. By inviting friends and acquaintances to join Nicegram, both the referrer and the new user benefit, fostering a growing network of connected users.

**Key Aspects of the Nicegram Referral System:**

* **Earn Gems for Referrals:** When you invite someone to Nicegram, and they join using your referral link, you earn [Gems](../gems.md) as a reward.
* **Multi-Level Earning Potential:** Not only do you earn [Gems](../gems.md) for direct referrals, but you also receive rewards for the activity of users brought in by your referrals, creating a multi-tiered earning structure.
  1. **Basic Accounts:** Standard users earn a 25% reward at each referral level.
  2. **Premium Accounts:** Earn a higher reward rate, with up to 50% in referral bonuses at both referral levels.
* **Simple Sharing Mechanism:** Nicegram makes it easy to share your referral link via social media, email, or direct messaging, expanding your potential reach.
* **Tracking and Analytics:** Monitor your referral success with in-app analytics, allowing you to see how many Gems you’ve earned from referrals and how your network is growing.
* **Benefits for New Users:** New users joining through a referral link often receive initial bonuses or special offers, making the invitation more appealing.

The Referral System is an integral part of Nicegram’s approach to building a robust and interactive community, rewarding users for contributing to the app’s growth.
