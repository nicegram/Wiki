## Welcome to Nicegram Website

This website can be used to have a sneak peek about <a href="https://t.me/nicegramapp" target="_blank">Nicegram</a> or like a ad, that's your decision.
# 
I've used Bootstrap to make this website, it's kinda lightweight so it should work on most networks, and most modern web browsers (like: Edge, Opera, Chrome, Edge Chromium, Safari, etc)

This file feels like a placeholder for the license but, eh i'm not really expert with ``README`` files
