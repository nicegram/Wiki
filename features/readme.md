## Nicegram returns you the joy of pure communication

- **Forget about unnecessary censorship.** You will no longer end up in a situation when someone knows better which groups, channels or bots you should or should not interact with. [Read more](/unblock)

- **Get more focus with Folders & Tabs.** Group chats by topic you want, or split them by type - channels, bots, private and more. Be productive on the messaging fields! To create folder: Left Corner - **Edit > New Folder**

- **Forwarding without Author**

- **Hide unused Tabs.** Decide whether you need to hide or show Contacts and Calls tabs at the bottom of your app.

- **Switch between seven accounts.** Multiple accounts now mean more than three, that’s limited in a standard Telegram app.

- **Instantly Save Messages** to your Cloud with a single tap.

- **Lost a Pin, But Not Forever.** Retrieve any hidden pinned message in any chat, now it's possible.  
You're an admin and want to get rid of the pinned message that plays on your nerves? You can simply hide it just for yourself, not only for everyone.

- **Admin like a boss.** Restrict users faster than a bullet. Long tap a message and proceed to an exception menu. Control exception duration down to the second.

- **Nicegram is not only NICE. It is SAFE to use.** Don’t just take my word for it. Go and check yourself the source code at: [https://github.com/nicegram](https://github.com/nicegram)
