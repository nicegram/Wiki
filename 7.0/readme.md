# Nicegram 7.0

It was a long time between Nicegram updates. A lot of things changed and a lot of features were implemented in official Telegram app.
I also assume lots of users switched to official app as well. But finally, here's something you can hear from Nicegram.

First of all, this update is based on latest TG sources, which is version 7.0.1 (7.1 will be available very soon!)

Due to this long suspension of Nicegram development, I've decided that it's became too hard to support current app code and it needs to be rewritten, so some features will be re-implemented slowly.

## Unique Nicegram features 7.0

- [**Updated**] [Chats & Messages unblock method](/unblock)
- Forward As Copy (without Author)
- Save to Cloud button for fast forwarding to your saved messages.
- Fast user restrict from context menu
- Support up to 10 accounts
- Messages translator via GTranslate
- [Premium] Quick Translate button
- Ability to hide contacts tab & tab names
- Themed bottom folder list

_Other Features are not re-implemented yet_ üò©

## Telegram implemented Nicegram's features

I mostly prefer official solution due to sync and support. Legacy Nicegram features will not overwrite existing functionality in future.

### Folders, Filters & Unlimited Pins

Now we have official and synced TG folders. You're welcome to use them.
Unfortunatelly, there's no method to export NG folders to TG, you need to do that manually (or you've already done that).

Nicegram also implements alternative design and position for folders list.

You can setup up to 10 folders with different filters and pin up to 100 chats in each folder. If it's not enough, you might register one more TG account.

### Missing Nicegram folders

Solutions:

- a) You now can create Telegram folders as described above. There's no automatic way, sorry.

### Missing chats / multiple archives / bugged pinned chats

Solutions:

- a) 10 Taps on settings icon (Debug Menu) > Reset Holes
- b) If a. not helped, try Debug Menu > Clear Database (this should not logout you from accounts. But always create backups)
- c) Reinstall app

### Infinitiy "Updating..."

Issue due to bug in Telegram sources. **Update to 7.1 version.**

Solutions:

- a) 10 Taps on settings icon (Debug Menu) > Clear Database & Cache (this should not logout you from accounts. But always create backups)
- b) Try to wait couple of minutes. If it's not fixed, you need to relogin to your account.
- c) If relogin still stuck you on load, try to add account via debug menu. Debug Menu > Accounts > Login > Production

### Filters on the Tabbar

Solutions:

- a) You can enable alternative folders style, it will move them to bottom.

### Can't restore Premium

- Jaibroken devices may have issues even without any patches installed. It may require complete JB removal (rebooting device or so) to proceed.
- iOS devices **BELOW iOS 13** (iOS 12.4.1, iOS 10 and etc) may have issues with restoring purchases. Reason unknown. You may update your OS if possible.

Solutions:

- a) Try to tap "Buy" again. It will not charge you.
- b) Make sure you're using proper AppStore account.

Solution for JB (by @pancakeufo):

- 1) Disable LocaliAPStore or similar tweaks if you have them

- 2) Drop your JB status with rebooting

### Crashes on iOS 10 and below

- Try to disable WIFI. Reason unknown.

### Crashes in background

Solutions:

- a) Reboot device or re-login to account. Something should help.
- b) Can be fixed after some time after update (probably a week).

### How to rollback?

- You can't, it's iOS.
- Or install Jailbreak.

## Nicegram restrictions

### VOIP Pushes

Nicegram missing some background features due to iOS 13+ restrictions

- Incoming calls in background.
**Solution** - install official Telegram app for calls. You can disable message notifications in iOS system settings to do not have duplicates
- Live location updates in background.
**Solution** - install official Telegram app to share a live location message
- Messages sync and badge number update in background
- Datacenter IP updates, which is useful for countries where Telegram may be blocked
- Notifications revoke when message was deleted or already seen

### Region availability

As a result of some Nicegram features, app was blocked in China region. Apple requires signed document from Chinese gov. All attempts to contact Chinese gov was unsuccessful. As well as publishing another China-specific app in AppStore on the same account, Apple treats it as a clone of Nicegram üòî

**Solution** for now: Download Nicegram with other AppStore account or join [Nicegram beta](/faq#download)

Obtaining Premium via other AppStore account may be possible with AppStore gift cards. Google for more info.

### Opening t.me links

iOS does not ask you which app to use for opening links. In case you can't open something via url staright in Nicegram, you can use third-party shortcuts

App uses `ng://` url scheme

### Payments

Telegram servers do not allow third-party apps to make native transactions in App via Apple Pay. You will be always redirected to a web-form.

## Premium

Let's be honest, Nicegram is not a business and I assume that Premium is kind of a donaton option to support and run Nicegram servers and it's development, so there're some fair rules:

- **$0.99** ~~$1.99~~ **[50% DISCOUNT]** for new users, until some more features coming soon.
- **Free** for already premium members (Tap "Restore purchases")

**Features:**

- Quick Translate button
- More Coming Soon...

## Community

It would be bad to not mention all the generous community members that help, translate, support and spread Nicegram and everything about it.

Special thanks to @xXMeliodas [for donating Apple Watch](https://t.me/nicegramdev/97) so I'm able to include AW app in Nicegram.

## Source Code

[https://github.com/nicegram/Telegram-iOS](https://github.com/nicegram/Telegram-iOS)
Branches master (current) and 5.15.5 (old) are available for contribution and inspection.

## Roadmap

You will hear more news soon. Since I have less time on NG now, I need some developer contribution assistance to the project, so updates can be released faster.
